unisearch_django
================

This is a Django app which provides frontend components for searching geodata
indexed by 
`GeoNode <http://geonode.org>`_ and/or 
`Registry <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/registry>`_.

It wraps the browser-based JavaScript app provided by `unisearch_frontend
<https://github.com/harts-boundless/unisearch_frontend>`_ for use from Django
apps such as GeoNode, including optional helpers for overriding GeoNode search
UIs with new UIs that can be configured to query GeoNode, Registry, or both
using their own search APIs.
